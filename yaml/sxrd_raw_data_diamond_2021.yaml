  title: Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Dataset - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples
  description: "A dataset of raw synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) images, recording crystallographic texture from two different pre-processed 
    Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-64) materials, analysing six differently orientated samples from each material. The aim of the work was to provide a 
    large dataset for testing and improving crystallographic texture refinement software from SXRD patterns.


    Prior to the experiment, the Ti-64 materials had been pre-rolled and then air-cooled to develop the microstructure, rolling to 50% and 
    87.5% reduction at 915ºC using a rolling mill at The University of Manchester. Rectangular samples (2 mm thick) were then machined from 
    these rolled blocks. The samples were cut along different directions, three samples along different orthogonal rolling directions, and 
    three at different angles to the rolling directions. The samples are referenced according to alignment of the rolling directions (RD – 
    rolling direction, TD – transverse direction, ND – normal direction) with the long horizontal (X) axis and short vertical (Y) axis of the 
    rectangular specimens. Data was recorded using a high energy 99.8 keV synchrotron X-ray beam and a 5 second exposure at the detector. The 
    slits were adjusted to give a 0.5 x 0.5 mm beam area, chosen to optimally resolve both the alpha (hexagonal close packed, hcp) and beta 
    (body-centred cubic, bcc) phase peaks. The SXRD data was recorded across each of the specimens by stage-scanning the beam in sequential 
    X-Y positions at 0.5 mm increments, forming a rectangular grid of measurement points across each sample. A powder Ti-64 sample was also 
    measured as a random texture standard.
  

    As well as the main experiment, 3 samples (sample 1, 2 and 3) were held together in different orders (1, 2, 3 ; 2, 1, 3 ; 2, 3, 1) and 
    analysed through-thickness, to measure how beam attenuation might affect the bulk texture measurement. In addition, different detector 
    exposure times (1 to 0.04 seconds) were also tested to analyse the impact of exposure time on overall intensity, to see how well the 
    alpha and beta peaks could be resolved from background noise at very fast acquisition frequencies.


    The raw data is in the form of synchrotron diffraction pattern images which has been separated according to experiment type. An accompanying 
    YAML text file contains associated beamline metadata for each measurement. Further details of the experimental setup can be found in a 
    pdf document.
  

    The material data folder contains further details of the material and sample orientations, including an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) 
    map that can be used to verify the crystallographic texture."
